[h1]Intro[/h1]
This is based on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2050370803]Blackout Edition[/url] and made for mainly [u][b]Japanese[/b][/u] players.
There are some features seen in the other great mods but customized as we, the Japanese, prefer. So, I do not consider using this version with other mutators together except the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819268190]Friendly HUD Mutator[/url]. Some mods must conflict with this.
